These codes are all for creating graphs using KDEs. 
The file X and Y, plot points (X,Y) at which a radiation level higher than the backgroun radiation was recorded. It then uses the gaussian KDE in order to build an image
The file X and Rad plot X points at which a radiation level higher than the background radiation was recorded. It uses the gaussian KDE in order to build a 2-D image with radiation levels serving as the second "dimension".
The file Y and Rad plot Y points at which a radiation level higher than the background radiation was recorded. It uses the gaussian KDE in order to build a 2-D image with radiation levels serving as the second "dimension".
